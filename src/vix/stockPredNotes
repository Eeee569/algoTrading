use last 

-choos a adn b and c, then incrament c by .1 each time with ab constant , then move b up by .1 and restart the process. After both a and b are done then incrament c by .1

- aab pair fials if after crosing b it returns to b without hitting c 

- 9 bar ema for smoothing maybe more bar 

- time it for failure, so say after 1 minute then look to see if it goes blow b and it fails, ignore all osolating before a minute. If it goes to c in the minute then its a sucsess, if it goes under b after that value then its a failure . maybe use 5 minutes 

- use 5 minute timeframe

- point b may be intbetween two time points so  wee need to check and get all theose pints 

-only do day by day 9:30 - 4 intra day non weekends  
	- worng just lkpook at data as a whole 

-sucsess rate as % whe know total pairs and how many were true and how may were false 

-weigt based on 

- a has to be 1 dollar way from b at a minimum 


- find all pints where a, b, b`(b-0.4) , and c were hit, put them insequential order. if the pattern abc come up then its a sucsess, if the pattern ab(b-0.4) or aba then its a failure. 
-prof calculator of #abc * (c-b) - #abb`*0.4. use the 5 minute time frame
